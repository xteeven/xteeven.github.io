I Presented the possible configuration for our interface including the control and the certification process

On progress


* [x] Get the brazilian norms
* [ ] Get a classified zone map
* [ ] get quotations for Zone 2
* [ ] Study design thinking
* [ ] study user centered design
* [ ] Choose the place where the hardware will be
* [ ] Read the norms

### Script.

Dear ####.
I am Steeven from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and I am looking for suppliers to provide us hardware for our current project with Petrobras. We are developing a supervisory interface to teleoperate a submarine robot. We must place our interface in an FPSO, so we are limited in terms of devices that we can use. We designed our software to work with some hardware requirements that are easy to meet in a conventional environment but not in a classified zone. Because of that, I am contacting you to ask you for quotations of 2 Screens, a CPU, a Tablet and a Control Panel. Currently, we are not sure which zone (1 or 2) Petrobras will assign us to place our interface, so we need quotations for both zones (if you can supply the devices for the respective zone).
Here is the list of devices required (also mentioned above):

- CPU: Minimum requirements:
    - i5 Processor
    - GTX 1060 Nvidia GPU
    - 8 GB Ram
- Two 19" Screens
- 10" Windows Tablet
- Custom Control Panel.

The CPU protection could be oil immersed for practice, but if you have an intrinsically safe option with fewer specifications we can evaluate it. We know that those requirements are hard to meet in zone 1 so you can give us quotations just for the devices you can supply or for the closest option you have for that zone. About the custom control panel, we just need to know if you can build that or not, if yes we will send you further information about the design.

Best Regards.
