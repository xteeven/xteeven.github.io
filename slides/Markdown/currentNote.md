## Mar 2018

### Last definitions

- Force Will be induced with springs
- Initial measurements without force sensor
- Track movement and velocity with camera (~250 fps)

### To-Do

* [x] Design A base that holds up the Mechanism. [Ongoing]
* [ ] Adapt Accelerometer [Ongoing]
* [x] Search for a feasible force sensor
* [x] Buy a Driver
* [ ] Buy or get springs
* [ ] design spring support
* [ ] buy sandpaper


### abstract

I Printed several pieces, I experimented several problems with the printer but finally I got it working. after a lot of pieces with errors I got a full piece that works as base but i fond an issue when trying to connect the stepper because the space between the base and the conectros was very small so I will remove a bit of plastic and then i will try again.

### Base design

Imrpoved the reference lines to adjust to the inner and outer boundarys of the ROM. I Pprinted several test models to check and measure the dimensions

[29 03 18] Final Base printed: I get the final model printed. with an additional curve to allow the motor wires.

### Tool Holder

I printed a box-shaped pen holder that I imagine to use with two springs. I inspired by cartesian circuit routers to do that design. I also constructed an option with Iron. Now i have two options. I need sandpaper to eliminate friction in the iron bar.
