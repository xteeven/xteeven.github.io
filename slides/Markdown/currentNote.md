# Notes On "Integrating Physics-based and Data-Driven Methods to Accurately Model Haptic Textures"  Steeven Villa


## Mar 2018

### Last definitions

- Force Will be induced with springs
- Initial measurements without force sensor
- Track movement and velocity with camera (~250 fps)

### To-Do

* [ ] Design A base that holds up the Mechanism.
* [ ] Adapt Accelerometer
* [ ] Search for a feasible force sensor
* [ ] Buy a Driver

- #### Force sensor task *[Already reported]*
I asked directly in ATI Technologies for their Nano17 sensor. the cost of this device is 5500 USD (including Capture device DAQ). Due its cost I asked the vendor to give me cheaper options and she gave me the Axia80 datasheet. A bigger sensor that does not meet our requeriments at price of 3500 USD.

- #### Design a Base that holds up the mechanism

I Started Designin the base. I Drew a sample part ```Mountv1.stl``` to test the new 3D printer. I found difficulties when trying to print. First i found that the standar software of BCN3D does not print over usb but only over SD. So I Searched for a software to print. I downloaded Simplify3D (Propietary software that needs to be licenced) and tryed to configure all the printer parameters, I got printed the test part and it fits in the structure. It need to be refined


- #### Adapt Accelerometer

- #### Adapt Springs

- #### Configure the camera
