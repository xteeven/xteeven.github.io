| ------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |

| n       | Non Incendive    | IEC/EN 60079-6 | 2      | electronics, equipment        |

- The types of protection are subdivided into several sub classes, linked to EPL (EQUIPMENT PROTECTION LEVEL): ma and mb, px, py and pz, ia, ib and ic. The a subdivisions have the most stringent safety requirements, taking into account more the one independent component faults simultaneously.

| Zone | Level     | ATEX | EPL |
| ---- | --------- | ---- | --- |
| 0    | Very High | 1G   | Ga  |
| 1    | High      | 2G   | Gb  |
| 2    | Normal    | 3G   | Gc  |
| 20   | Very High | 1D   | Da  |
| 21   | High      | 2D   | Db  |
| 22   | Normal    | 3D   | Dc  |

- EPL Ga: Equipment for explosive atmospheres due to the presence of gas, with a level of
protection 'very high', which is not a source of ignition in normal operation, or in case of expected
failure or when subjected to a rare failure.

- EPL Gb: Equipment for use in explosive atmospheres due to the presence of gas, with a 'high'
level of protection that is not the source of ignition in normal operation or when subject to expected
malfunctions, although not on a regular basis.

- EPL Gb: Equipment for use in explosive atmospheres due to the presence of gas, with a 'high'
level of protection that is not the source of ignition in normal operation or when subject to expected
malfunctions, although not on a regular basis.

- EN 60079-14 standard of March 2010 introduced a method for risk assessment that considers the
equipment levels of protection (EPL).

## Our requirements

Many modern devices will carry both ATEX and IECEx approval, and so the label will display codes and information from both schemes. Some of that information is common, some is not. A typical ATEX and IECEx label is shown below.

## Highliths 

1. It must be purposely-designed for use within an explosive atmosphere at normal temperatures and pressures.
2. The atmosphere may contain gas, vapour, mist or dust as a fuel, but must be based on air as the oxidiser. 
3. The equipment must have an ignition source in and of itself, such as a spark, hot surface, etc.

Because of these criteria, simple items such as hammers are not covered as they do not generate sparks in and of themselves (only when struck against another item), and some mechanical devices such as hand-operated valves are excluded under statements issued by the EEC, as they are not considered to move fast enough to generate any frictional heat sufficient to cause ignition. 


# Prototype Design

## Components

All components were listed in google sheets to be purchased.
But yet I have to define the material to enclose all the control.

- [PT] Dependendo das dimenções dos componentes é necessario fazer um corte laser
