# Control 2nd Stage

## The context of use:
Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it.

## Requeriments
Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful.

## Design Solutions
This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design.

## Evaluate designs
Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.

### UCD
- The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments...
- Users are involved throughout design and development.
- The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation
- The process is iterative.
- The design addresses the whole user experience.
- The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

## DT
- Empathise with the potential user(s) of the product or service you’re designing for. You can do this by talking to such people using appropriate interview techniques, observing them using ethnographic techniques, or taking their role for a period of time.
- Synthesize your findings, and define/reframe the problem you’re trying to solve, focusing on the user’s viewpoint.
- Generate a large amount of ideas to solve the problem. Generate as many as possible in order to encourage innovation. Often, the first idea is too generic and not really innovative.
- To validate an idea, the simplest is to make a prototype of it. It doesn’t have to be high definition. A prototype should illustrate your idea in a way you can test it with people to see if it works. The important point here is not create an artefact of some sort that can be used, so that people can interact with it and critique (which is easier and more precise than critiquing ideas)
- Test your idea with people to see what works and what doesn’t, so that you can refine it.
