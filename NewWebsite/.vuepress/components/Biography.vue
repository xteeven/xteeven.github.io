         Computer Scientist and Mechatronic Engineer, and PhD Researcher in the Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media group at LMU Munich. My research field is human computer interaction, particularly human augmentation/Human-computer Integration/Human-computer symbiosis. I'm highly interested in creating technologies to help humans overcome their natural sensory, cognitive, and motor limitations.

Research takes time, effort and commitment, and more important: good mentors. I had the chance to work with knowledgeable people across my career as a researcher. I acknowledge all of those professors and researchers who taught me the tips and tricks of the academy. Hereby, I will tell you who influenced my academic path, let us start from the beginning:
I got my bachelor's degree from the Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano de Medellin (Colombia). Where my passion for research started, thanks to <b>Prof. Diego Hincapie Zuluaga</b> and <b>Prof. Dr. Edwar Torres</b> and their work in thermodynamic simulations using the Finite Elements Method. Afterward, at Masters's level, and having moved to Brazil, I applied this knowledge to propose, under the advice of <b>Prof. Dr. Anderson Maciel (UFRGS)</b>, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849318301389">method</a> to simulate phase change in real-time applications. Brazil was a productive journey; I also had the chance to learn haptics and immerse myself in <a href="https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/202057">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, exploring areas like mid-air haptics, force feedback, and texture simulation. During the last semester of my master's, I had the chance to work with <b>Dr. Claudio Pacchierotti</b> and <b>Prof. Maud Marchal</b> at INRIA Rennes (France). Together we developed a <a href="https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/202057">study</a> on stiffness perception of tangible objects as a continuation of the work of Dr. Pacchierotti in wearable haptics. Once I finished my time in France, I had the chance to work with Prof. <b>Dr. Albrecht Schmidt</b> and <b>Dr. Tonja Machula</b> at Human-centered Ubiquitous Media in Munich (Germany) â€“ my current affiliation. At HCUM, We are actively working to find ways to enhance human capabilities and create new senses. The world has changed, and we have a unique opportunity to accelerate evolution through embodied devices. If this topic is from your interest, find me in the <a href="/social/">social networks</a> and share with me your thoughts about the future of augmented humans and interaction with machines.
